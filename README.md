**numbers game** 

- Level 1 is a standard number guessing game where you are trying to guess the random number the program picked and based off your guess you will be told if your guess is either too low or too high.
- Level 2 is a more difficult number guessing game and the most difficult out of the 3 games. In this game you are again, guessing the number that the program picked, but now every time you guess the program will change the number you are trying to guess. The program can't go back to the same number twice.
- Level 3 is a code breaker style game where you will be trying to guess a random number picked by the program between 100 and 999. Every time you guess it will tell you the the status of your 3 numbers. Your number is either at the correct spot and is the correct number, is at the wron spot but is the correct number, or is at the wrong spot and is the wrong number.
